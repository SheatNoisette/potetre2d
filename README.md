# Potetre2d

L'as tu faite? Potetre
---

A really small (in size) game engine for 2D games, made originally for the
4Mb Game Jam. We were disappointed by the lack of 2D game engine that could
fit in 4Mb, so we made one. The objective of this project is to make a LÃ¶ve2D
like engine, but with a smaller footprint. We didn't wanted to write bare
C code, so any game written with this engine are written in Wren.
